      Colors have a magical way of influencing how we think and feel. A bright yellow room can energize your mood,
      while soft blues calm the chaos in your mind. As a creative, I’ve always found that using color intentionally
      sparks my imagination. When I write, I surround myself with colorful sticky notes, vibrant pens, and light-themed
      digital wallpapers. It’s not just aesthetic—it’s fuel for thought. Studies even show that color affects memory
      and decision-making. That’s why design, branding, and even classrooms pay so much attention to it. Your environment
      shapes your output. Whether you’re painting, coding, or journaling, try experimenting with different hues and tones.
      You might find that your best ideas are hidden behind a color you haven’t used yet.
