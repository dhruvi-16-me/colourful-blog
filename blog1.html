      Mornings are underrated. While most people dread early alarms, I find them to be a sacred part of the day.
      The moment you wake up and the world is quiet — that’s a rare kind of peace. The sun gently lights up the sky,
      birds begin to chirp, and the cool breeze carries clarity. A warm cup of tea or coffee in hand, journaling
      thoughts, or stretching in silence — these rituals bring me joy. I feel like mornings give us a fresh chance,
      a new start every single day. No matter how messy yesterday was, the morning whispers, “Try again.” 
      Embracing mornings has helped me become more focused and present in life. They’ve become my anchor in the chaos.
